          Whatever you plan to study in Denmark, the step students most often underestimate is the
          Danish-language requirement — Danish-taught programmes typically expect around B2, and the
          Studieprøven is a common gateway for Danish-taught programmes. Choose a field to see the language pathway
          and practise honestly for the Danish exams — the Prøve i Dansk ladder and Studieprøven.
