// Real-entity gate — blocks invented messages attributed to real organisations.
//
// Ported from AlmiDutch, where the bank had shipped letters signed by real municipalities
// and seven named businesses, three of which turned out to be real practices. Every one
// survived review, because the surrounding facts were right. That is the danger: an
// invented document reads as credible exactly when nothing else about it is wrong.
//
// Two things this port inherits, both learned the hard way rather than designed in:
//
//   1. IT SCANS PARSED STRINGS, NOT JSON. The first Dutch version scanned
//      JSON.stringify(payload) and was blind to the very violation it was written for:
//      in serialised JSON a newline is a backslash and the LETTER n, so in
//      "hilsen,\nAarhus Kommune" the character before the name is a letter, \b never
//      matches, and a signature sails through. Mid-sentence names were caught, which is
//      why it looked like it worked — but a signature always sits right after a line
//      break. AlmiSwiss had already hit this and fixed it; the lesson was in the network
//      and got reintroduced anyway.
//
//   2. A NAME MUST SIT ON THE SAME LINE AS ITS CATEGORY NOUN ([ \t], not \s). Otherwise
//      a heading followed by an ordinary capitalised word reads as an institution:
//      Dutch produced "buurthuis Elke" (Elke = "every") and Swedish "biblioteket Varje".
//      A gate that reports violations that are not there gets switched off, and then it
//      protects nothing — the same end state as the memory-only rule these replace.
//
// Norwegian shape, which is NOT the Dutch one:
//   - Word order reverses. Dutch writes "Gemeente Almere"; Norwegian writes "Oslo
//     kommune" — the name comes FIRST. A pattern ported literally would never fire.
//   - Definiteness carries the meaning. "Kommune" follows a name; "kommunen" means "the
//     municipality" generically and is exactly what we want authors to write. Flagging
//     the definite form would flag every correct usage.
//
// Deliberately NOT flagged: a real place as setting, a real station in a transport
// announcement, a public body named factually in a knowledge question. Those are
// accurate, not misattributed.
